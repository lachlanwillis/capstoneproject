        <h4>Why {{appName}}?</h4>
        <p>
          You might be surprised to hear that approximately <strong>11 million tonnes</strong> of waste exists in Australia's biggest "waste dump",
           The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which lies in the Pacific Ocean. We have found through various statistics detailing that <strong>80%</strong>
            of this waste has come from local waterways which then lead out to sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why we created {{appName}}! We want to educate people on the impact of waterway litter in an interactive and rewarding way. 
          The aim of Waterways Litter is to create awareness around the impact of littering on the world's waterways. 
          By creating a fun and interactive service that also educates users as they participate,
           our goal is to change the way people think about litter and the disposal of it.

        <h4>{{appName}} Leaderboard</h4>
        <p>
          We have created a leaderboard and points ranking system in order to reward you for your efforts of finding rubbish in your local waterways.
          The leaderboard system has the ability to rank by state, postcode or just list the results nationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works by giving you a number of points based on the number of pieces of rubbish our trained neural network finds in your images.
          By allowing geolocation through the site, we can then use this information to set your postcode so that you can rank your account against other suburbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also implemented a levelling up feature, so by reaching a certain number of points you will automatically rank up.
          So get on out there and start uploading rubbish in your local waterway and start collecting points to rival your friends and family!
        </p>

          <i>Note: you can remove yourself from the leaderboard by going to your account settings and opting out.</i>
